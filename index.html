<h2>GENDER INEQUALITY</h2>

<p> Gender inequality is a situation whereby there is a believe men and women are not equal. It affect women's potential a lot.
<br> These issues happen in different cities in olden days and it is still happening now. These issues also arise in technology, people believe women do not know a lot about technology whereas a woman named "ADA LOVELACE" was one of the first person to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" but her work was not recognised. This is a good example of Gender Inequality.

<p> Women are expected to stay at home and do housechores and take care of their kids. infact, they believe women do not need education when all their education will be spent in their husband's house.
<br>Nowadays, things are changing but there is still part of the continent that these issues are occuring which I expect will be erased finally.
